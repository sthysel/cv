# Work Experience

## Sept 2016 - Current BHP

I am currently employed at BHP as Principal Software Engineer specialising
in Computer Vision Machine Learning and MLOps. 

I have hold various roles at BHP in the last five years, listed below.

https://www.bhp.com

### Principal Computer Vision machine learning

I trained computer vision models using Tensorflow and Keras to classify live CCTV video
streams to react on fault conditions in various applications. I also developed the
inference and heuristic code around the model allowing the solution to actuate
the various PLC and warning systems that reacts on the fault conditions. I'm
currently developing the machine learning operations pipeline managing the process of
training data capture, versioning, model training and model deployment to
production, using existing BHP Azure iot-edge infrastructure.

### Principal Data Engineer, Digital Facory WAIO

My primary role is building out AWS infrastructure for a BHP bespoke machine
learning and forecasting system, focusing on data integration. Infrastructure is
managed using Terraform tooling and modules.

### Principal Software Engineer Innovation Center

My primary roles are software architect, programmer and systems integrator. I
focused on systems built around machine learning stacks making use of GPU and
Google's Coral TPU. Solutions are implemented in Python, hosted on Linux,
containerized and managed using the balena.io platform.

We build a modular computer vision and sensor fusion framework and implemented a
personnel safety system on top of that. 

Video and other sensor feeds are fused into a real-time spatial awareness stream
informing system state which in turns trigger warnings and alerts to machine
operators and nearby personnel. Audio and visual alarms and warnings include
synthesized context specific voice alerts and industry standard RAGA strobe
light actuation via a CAN bus.

The system is composed of various independent sub-components all communication
via a common local MQTT message queue running on a edge compute device.
Detection and system telemetry is communicated via 4G/LTE modem to a AWS stack
used for analysis and visualization. Device fleet management is done using the
Balena cloud service.

The system was developed in line with BHP's global technology and innovation
push to make use of emerging technologies to enhance safety and reduce at-risk
work.

I worked on number of other ML and computer vision solutions focusing on
identifying and reporting production and ore quality issues.

### Specialist Engineer production automation systems. 

Projects I worked on include the SMART data logger project as well as the Magnet
telemetry monitoring system.

I worked in the Production Automation Systems team at BHP as specialist
technical engineer. Most activities during this period revolved around data
aggregation and sensor fusing systems that aggregated various data streams into
a single common source of truth via a extensive set of bespoke ETL components I
developed.

My primary responsibilities revolved around the software architecture,
implementation and deployment of device status and telemetry data capturing
ETL software services. These services were deployed close to the interrogated
devices on various physical and virtual platforms.

I worked on various projects during this time, most notably the SMART data
logger project, a precursor to the Dahling data logger project which gathers
data of SME using CAN and other protocols. And MAGNET, a status aggregating
system focusing predominantly on in-pit telemetry systems.

Enabling technologies were Linux, Python, Kafka and MQTT.
